API gives access to customers, accounts, locations, product configuration, etc.

Why?
connect to our database
Does not need the ERP to be up and running to extract data as it extracts the data directly from the databases.
Restful and consistent. New and simpler database schema. 
Better documented than the ERP API endpoints.
all the databases are connected to the same service.

How?

The restless API from Flask, connects to all the PostgreSQL databases that the ERP NGUs (Next Generation Utilities) have and to AWS DynamoDB tables depending on the models configuration.

concept:
This Flask-Restless API connects to an existing ERP database and generates REST endpoints for some key customer related tables. These include accounts, phone numbers, addresses, customer info, etc.
